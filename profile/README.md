## Reinforcement Learning

CSI-Agent group works on incorporation of data-driven multi-task, multi-modal,
continuous learning model architectures in the context of reinforcement learning to
address the problems (sample-inefficiency, low generalization) of real-world adoption of
reinforcement learning. CSI-Agent group develops pretrained behavior-driven models that
can be adopted for downstream agent task learning in real-world settings.

## Embodied Agent

CSI-Agent group conducts the research on various embodied agent scenarios including
drone, robot, and autonomous driving where the embodied agent learns to take optimal
actions for achieving its goals in the environment, and can adapt its behaviors to
changes in the environment or its goals. To do so, CSI-Agent group employs several
machine learning techniques such as imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and
multi-modal learning.

## Intelligent System

CSI-Agent group focuses on system intelligence areas including network-storage-learning
system optimization, autonomous system control, federated learning with NPUs, and
networked real-time CPS (Cyber-Physical System), aiming at the application of
data-driven deep learning technologies on large-scale real-world system automation that
requires optimal sequential decisions.
